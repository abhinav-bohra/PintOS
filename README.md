# PintOS
[Pintos](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html) is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way. 

As part of OS Lab; we have worked on strengthening the following modules:-
- Alarm Clock
- Multilevel feedback queue scheduling (MLFQS)
- User Programs
